# Image-Edge-Detection-using-Sobel-Prewitt-Operator
Experiment 5a: Sobel Operator
  The Sobel operator is a popular edge detection technique in image processing that uses convolution with two 3x3 kernels to compute the gradient of the image intensity. It is particularly effective for detecting edges in images.
Experiment 5b: Prewitt Operator
  The Prewitt operator is another edge detection technique that uses convolution with two 3x3 kernels to compute the gradient of the image intensity. It is similar to the Sobel operator but uses different convolution kernels.
